# aitools
Implements an AI tool-calling system. Discovers and registers bash scripts as tools from a specified folder, sends prompts to an AI API with these tools available, and automatically executes the tools when the AI requests them, creating a complete function-calling loop that can handle multiple iterations of tool calls and responses.
